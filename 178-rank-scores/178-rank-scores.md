</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write a solution to find the rank of the scores. The ranking should be calculated according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The scores should be ranked from the highest to the lowest.</li>
	<li>If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking.</li>
	<li>After a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no holes between ranks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>score</code> in descending order.</p>

<p>The result format is in the following example.</p>
