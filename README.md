# LeetCode Submissions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This collection serves as a personal archive of my problem-solving journey on LeetCode, primarily focusing on SQL challenges.

## ‚ú® About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to housing my accepted solutions to various coding problems encountered on LeetCode. It acts as a comprehensive backup of my work and a reference for different algorithmic and data structure approaches, particularly in the realm of database queries.

The solutions within this repository are organized to provide a clear and accessible overview of my problem-solving efforts.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each problem's solution and its accompanying details are organized into dedicated folders. The naming convention for these folders follows the pattern of `[Problem_ID]-[Problem_Title_Slug]`.

Inside each problem folder, you will typically find:

* `[Problem_ID]-[Problem_Title_Slug].html`: The original problem statement as it appears on LeetCode. This HTML file provides the full context of the challenge, including the problem description, examples, constraints, and sometimes hints.
* `[Submission_Date] - [Submission_Status] - [Runtime_Details].[Language_Extension]`: One or more files containing my submitted solution(s) for that particular problem. The filename includes the date of submission, the outcome (e.g., `Accepted`, `Wrong Answer`, `Runtime Error`), and performance metrics.

## üíª Languages & Domains

My solutions are primarily focused on:

* **SQL:** Dominant language for database-related problems.
* **JavaScript:** Solutions for some algorithmic challenges.
* *(Add any other languages here if you have solutions in them, e.g., Python, Java)*

## üöÄ Getting Started (Browsing)

To explore the solutions:

1.  Navigate through the folders directly on GitHub.
2.  Each folder corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem.
3.  Open the `.html` file to view the problem statement.
4.  Open the `.sql` (or `.js`, etc.) files to see my submitted solutions. Pay attention to the filename for details like submission status and performance.
